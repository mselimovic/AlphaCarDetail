      <p>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</p> We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area
      (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data
      collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way. What is
      GDPR? GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by
      companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data. What is personal data? Any
      data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that
      could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data
      extends beyond a person's name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions;
      genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity. The Data
      Protection Principles include requirements such as: • Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal,
      and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect. • Personal data should
      only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must
      specify why they need the personal data when they collect it. • Personal data should be held no longer than
      necessary to fulfil its purpose. • People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data.
      They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to
      another organization. <br><br> <p>Why is GDPR important? </p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should
      protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by
      increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to
      do. At Help Scout we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security
      and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation. Individual Data Subject's
      Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject
      rights requirements of GDPR. processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do
      store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we
      dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer
      than 60 days. We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the
      ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self service from
      the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our customer support team is here
